Image Compression Using Autoencoders
Overview
This project implements image compression techniques using autoencoders. Autoencoders are neural networks that learn to compress data by encoding it into a lower-dimensional representation and then reconstructing the original data. The objective is to efficiently reduce the size of image files while retaining as much quality as possible.

Features
Compression of images using convolutional autoencoders.
Reconstruction of images from compressed representations.
Supports various image formats (JPEG, PNG, etc.).
Visual comparison of original and reconstructed images.
Requirements
Python 3.x
TensorFlow or PyTorch
NumPy
OpenCV or PIL
Matplotlib
Install the required libraries with:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/image-compression-autoencoder.git
cd image-compression-autoencoder
Install the dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Place your images in the data/ directory.

Run the training script:

bash
Copy code
python train.py
After training, test the model using:

bash
Copy code
python test.py
Visualize results by running:

bash
Copy code
python visualize.py
Training the Autoencoder
The autoencoder is trained on a dataset of images. The train.py script preprocesses images, constructs the model, and trains it using mean squared error loss. You can adjust the model architecture in model.py.

Hyperparameters
Learning Rate: 0.001
Batch Size: 32
Epochs: 50
Modify these hyperparameters in train.py as needed.

Testing the Model
The testing script compresses a sample image using the trained model and reconstructs it. The original and reconstructed images are saved in the results/ directory for comparison.
