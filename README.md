# Image Compression Using Autoencoders

## Overview

This project implements image compression techniques using autoencoders. Autoencoders are neural networks that learn to compress data by encoding it into a lower-dimensional representation and then reconstructing the original data. The objective is to efficiently reduce the size of image files while retaining as much quality as possible.
